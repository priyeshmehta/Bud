Bud:

Overview:
- The app uses a MVVM design pattern.
- Unit tests added with the aid of mock objects which are injected in.

Pods:
- It uses Quick and Nimble to write unit tests.

Design decisions:
- Due to a lack to of time the design isnt quite up to the prototype, this was a trade off between having an MVP which is fully functional and has met all the requirements.
- Also it would be good to have a conversation with the designer about why the designs don't make use of the iOS standard ui for editing table views :)
